<pre>
Her fever dreams hang a hair
over the bedside -and down
                        .
                      over

the white linen skirt, gazing
into
that gap

      -
      
that place,
  where her thoughts tend to hide.

And when soft breezes wake her briefly,

between new conversations,
with an old friend,
maybe
she sighs, that the sun still lingers,
or that the icebox is so far away.

down the hall,
      across the steps of cool tile,
  humming its favorite tune.
